This plugin is for Godot 4

The aim of this plugin is to provide a system that will genrate dungeon floor layouts, as seen in games like "The Binding of Isaac" or "Moonlighter", by implementing various algorithm that generate room layouts. It does not generate the rooms themselves, only their placement in a level (what can be seen on the "map").

The Utils provides methods for detecting briges and articulation points (together with connectivity), Shortest distances and paths between all cells.
